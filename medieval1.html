        <h2>Bhakti Movement</h2>
        <p>The Bhakti Movement, which spanned from the 7th to the 17th century, was a socio-religious movement in India that emphasized devotion to a personal god as the path to salvation. It sought to transcend the rigidities of caste and promote a direct, personal connection with the divine.</p>

        <h2>Origins and Influences</h2>
        <p>The Bhakti Movement originated in South India and gradually spread to various parts of the country. Influenced by the Alvars and Nayanars in Tamil Nadu, as well as Sant poets like Kabir, Ravidas, and Tulsidas in the North, the movement aimed to democratize spirituality and break down social barriers.</p>

        <h2>Key Beliefs</h2>
        <p>Followers of the Bhakti Movement believed in the concept of a formless, omnipresent, and compassionate divine. Devotees expressed their love and devotion through poetry, music, and rituals, emphasizing an intimate and personal relationship with the chosen deity.</p>

        <h2>Prominent Saints</h2>
        <p>Several saints played a crucial role in the Bhakti Movement, such as Kabir, a weaver-saint who emphasized the oneness of God; Ravidas, a cobbler-saint known for his devotional hymns; and Tulsidas, a poet-saint who composed the epic Ramcharitmanas.</p>

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>
        <p>The Bhakti Movement had a profound social impact by challenging the caste system and promoting social equality. It cut across religious boundaries, attracting followers from Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh communities, fostering a spirit of unity and tolerance.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>The Bhakti Movement left a lasting legacy in Indian culture and spirituality. Its emphasis on direct devotion and personal experience of the divine influenced subsequent religious and philosophical developments, contributing to the richness of India's cultural and religious tapestry.</p>
