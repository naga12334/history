        <h2>Introduction to Buddhism</h2>
        <p>Buddhism, founded by Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha) in the 6th century BCE, began in ancient India and subsequently spread across Asia. The teachings of Buddhism revolve around the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, emphasizing the cessation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment.</p>

        <h2>Early Spread of Buddhism</h2>
        <p>After Buddha's enlightenment, his teachings were initially transmitted orally among his followers, known as monks and nuns. The spread of Buddhism gained momentum as disciples traveled to various regions to share the Dharma, the teachings of Buddha.</p>

        <h2>Spread to Southeast Asia</h2>
        <p>Buddhism gradually spread to Southeast Asia through both maritime and overland trade routes. Missionaries and traders played a vital role in disseminating Buddhist teachings to countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.</p>

        <h2>Transmission to East Asia</h2>
        <p>The Silk Road served as a significant conduit for the spread of Buddhism to East Asia. Missionaries and traders facilitated the transmission of Buddhist scriptures and teachings to China, where it integrated with indigenous beliefs, giving rise to various schools of Chinese Buddhism.</p>

        <h2>Buddhism in Central Asia and Tibet</h2>
        <p>Buddhism also made its way into Central Asia and Tibet. Monastic centers, such as those in Dunhuang along the Silk Road, became important hubs for the dissemination of Buddhist knowledge. In Tibet, Buddhism merged with local Bon traditions.</p>

        <h2>Spread to Southeast Asia</h2>
        <p>Buddhism continued its journey to Southeast Asia, influencing cultures and societies in regions like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The Theravada and Mahayana traditions coexisted, contributing to the diversity of Buddhist practices in the region.</p>

        <h2>Buddhism in the Modern World</h2>
        <p>Today, Buddhism has become a global religion, with followers and practitioners worldwide. The diverse schools of Buddhism, including Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, continue to impact philosophy, art, and culture across continents.</p>
