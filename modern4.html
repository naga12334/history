        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Emergency in India refers to a 21-month period from 1975 to 1977 during which a state of emergency was declared by the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. The Emergency period was marked by the suspension of civil liberties, press censorship, and the arrest of political opponents.</p>

        <h2>Background and Reasons</h2>
        <p>The Emergency was declared in response to internal political turmoil, economic challenges, and the Allahabad High Court's judgment declaring Indira Gandhi's election to the Lok Sabha (lower house of India's Parliament) null and void. The government cited the need for a strong response to maintain law and order.</p>

        <h2>Suspension of Civil Liberties</h2>
        <p>During the Emergency, fundamental rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Indian Constitution were suspended. There were widespread reports of political repression, arrests of opposition leaders, and censorship of the media. The government's actions were criticized for undermining democratic principles.</p>

        <h2>Political Opposition and Resistance</h2>
        <p>Several political leaders, activists, and journalists were arrested during the Emergency, leading to a suppression of political opposition. However, there was also resistance and protest against the government's actions, with movements advocating for the restoration of democratic rights and an end to authoritarian rule.</p>

        <h2>End of the Emergency</h2>
        <p>The Emergency was lifted in 1977, and general elections were held, leading to a change in government. The Janata Party, a coalition of opposition parties, came to power, and Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister. The Emergency period had a profound impact on Indian politics and public discourse.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Lessons</h2>
        <p>The Emergency remains a controversial and debated period in Indian history. While some argue that it was necessary to maintain stability, others view it as an infringement on democratic values. The Emergency serves as a reminder of the importance of safeguarding democratic institutions and the rule of law.</p>
