        <p>Sufis focus on the concept of "Tawhid" (the oneness of God) and strive for spiritual purification. They engage in practices such as Dhikr (remembrance of God), meditation, and Sama (ecstatic music) to attain a state of spiritual ecstasy and unity with the divine.</p>

        <h2>Prominent Sufi Saints</h2>

Notable figures include Rumi, a Persian poet and mystic; Ibn Arabi, a philosopher and poet; and Al-Hallaj, a mystic known for his controversial expressions of divine unity.</p>

        <h2>Social Impact</h2>

Sufis often engage in charitable activities and emphasize the importance of inner spiritual transformation, fostering a sense of unity and understanding among diverse communities.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
