        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The arrival of Europeans in the Indian subcontinent, beginning in the late 15th century, marked a significant chapter in world history. European powers, including the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British, sought to establish trade routes, expand their empires, and gain influence in the rich and diverse lands of South Asia.</p>

        <h2>Portuguese Exploration</h2>
        <p>The Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach the Indian Ocean in the late 15th century under the leadership of Vasco da Gama. They established trade posts and sought control over key maritime routes, contributing to the spice trade and establishing a presence in Goa.</p>

        <h2>Dutch and French Presence</h2>
        <p>The Dutch and French followed the Portuguese, establishing their trading posts and colonies in different parts of the Indian subcontinent. The Dutch East India Company and the French East India Company played prominent roles in the maritime trade and political affairs of the region.</p>

        <h2>British East India Company</h2>
        <p>The British East India Company became a dominant force in the 17th century, with a focus on trade and later expanding into territorial control. The company's influence grew, leading to the establishment of the British Raj in the 19th century, a significant period of British colonial rule in India.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Trade and Culture</h2>
        <p>The arrival of Europeans had a profound impact on trade, introducing new goods and technologies to the subcontinent. However, it also led to conflicts and changes in the existing political and cultural landscapes. The European presence contributed to the integration of Indian goods into the global market.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Independence</h2>
        <p>The legacy of European arrival in the Indian subcontinent is complex, marked by both positive and negative influences. While it contributed to economic changes and cultural exchanges, it also played a role in the later struggles for independence as Indian society faced challenges related to colonial rule.</p>
