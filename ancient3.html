        <h2>Establishment of the Maurya Empire</h2>
        <p>The Maurya Empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya around 322 BCE. He overthrew the Nanda dynasty, establishing the Mauryan rule over a vast territory in the Indian subcontinent. Chandragupta's advisor, Chanakya, played a crucial role in the empire's formation.</p>

        <h2>Rulers of the Maurya Empire</h2>
        <p>The Maurya Empire had notable rulers who contributed to its expansion and governance:</p>

        <h3>1. Chandragupta Maurya (c. 322 – 298 BCE)</h3>
        <p>Chandragupta was the founder of the Maurya Empire. He successfully conquered the Magadha region and later expanded his empire, encompassing a significant portion of North India. His alliance with Chanakya, also known as Kautilya, played a pivotal role in his military successes.</p>

        <h3>2. Bindusara (c. 298 – 273 BCE)</h3>
        <p>Bindusara, the son of Chandragupta, continued the expansion of the Maurya Empire. His reign saw the incorporation of additional territories into the empire, extending its influence to the Deccan region.</p>
