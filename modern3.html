        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Green Revolution refers to a set of research, development, and technology transfer initiatives that took place between the 1940s and the 1960s, primarily in developing countries like India and Mexico. The aim was to increase agricultural productivity through the adoption of modern farming techniques and technologies.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>The Green Revolution introduced high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of crops, along with modern irrigation techniques and the increased use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. These innovations aimed to boost crop yields and make agriculture more efficient, addressing issues of food scarcity and hunger.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Agriculture</h2>
        <p>The adoption of HYVs led to a significant increase in crop yields, transforming traditional agriculture. Crops like wheat and rice saw substantial improvements, helping meet the growing food demand. However, the focus on certain crops and intensive use of agrochemicals also raised environmental and sustainability concerns.</p>

        <h2>Social and Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>The Green Revolution had mixed social and economic impacts. While it increased agricultural productivity and improved food security, it also led to changes in landownership patterns, with larger farms benefiting more. The mechanization of agriculture reduced the demand for labor, impacting rural employment.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Criticisms</h2>
        <p>The Green Revolution faced challenges such as environmental degradation, water scarcity, and the depletion of soil nutrients. Critics argue that it contributed to social inequalities, focusing on the interests of large landowners and agribusinesses while neglecting the needs of small-scale farmers and environmental sustainability.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Future Perspectives</h2>
        <p>The Green Revolution had a lasting impact on global agriculture, shaping the way food is produced and consumed. While it helped alleviate immediate hunger concerns, it also highlighted the need for sustainable and equitable agricultural practices. Future agricultural initiatives aim to balance productivity with environmental and social considerations.</p>
