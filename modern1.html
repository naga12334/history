        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Indian Independence Movement was a historic struggle for freedom and self-rule against British colonial rule in India. Spanning several decades, the movement was characterized by non-violent civil disobedience, mass protests, and efforts to achieve political independence and social justice.</p>

        <h2>Early Movements and Leaders</h2>
        <p>Early efforts for independence included the Indian National Congress (INC), formed in 1885, and the leadership of figures like Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Subhas Chandra Bose. These leaders advocated for constitutional reforms and greater Indian representation.</p>

        <h2>Non-Cooperation and Civil Disobedience</h2>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi emerged as a key leader, advocating non-cooperation and civil disobedience as powerful tools against British rule. Iconic movements such as the Salt March (1930) and the Quit India Movement (1942) mobilized millions and intensified the demand for independence.</p>

        <h2>Partition and Independence</h2>
        <p>The struggle for independence gained momentum after World War II. Mountbatten Plan in 1947 led to the partition of India, creating the independent nations of India and Pakistan. India officially gained independence on August 15, 1947, marking the end of British colonial rule.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Nation-Building</h2>
        <p>The Indian Independence Movement left a lasting legacy, shaping the political, social, and cultural identity of modern India. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and others played crucial roles in the nation's early years, laying the foundation for a democratic and secular India.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Achievements</h2>
        <p>The movement faced challenges, including communal tensions leading to the partition and ongoing socio-economic issues. Despite challenges, India's successful transition to independence marked a significant achievement, inspiring other nations in their struggles against colonialism.</p>
